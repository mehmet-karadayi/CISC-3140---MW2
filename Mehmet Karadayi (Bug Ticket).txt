Summary:
        Mouse cursor disappears on the MacBook display when you switch from one application to another.


Steps to Reproduce:
        * Open several applications to run at the same time.
        * Open a browser application and have multiple tabs running
        * Press Command + Tab to switch from one window to another. 


Expected Results:
        The mouse cursor should continue to appear on the location as it appeared on the previous window.


Actual Results:
        The mouse cursor is invisible to the user.  The user can still click on items and drop down menus, however, it is             difficult to pinpoint the exact location/position of the cursor.


Temporary Fix:
        The cursor re-appears when you move the invisible cursor to the top of the screen and single-click on the mouse pad.
